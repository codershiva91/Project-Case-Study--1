The figure shows the bifurcation of the human artery, blood flow rate into and out of a blood flow network is specified below.

(blood flow rate: micro liters per minute)

Assume the unknown flow direction, solve the nodes of the network flow to derive the linear system of equation.

Convert the network flow figure into matrix AX=B, the arrow indicates the flow direction. 

a)Find the unknown flow direction or non-arrow direction in the graph.

b) Unknown flow direction is an unknown variable or solution point, find the norms of the unknown variable, rank(A), rank(A/B) or rank(A, B) and Rank-Nullity of matrix.
